# CSS Only Section Toggle

This is a beginner-friendly project that demonstrates how to show and hide different sections of a webpage using **only HTML and CSS**, without JavaScript.

When a particular div is clicked, a specific section is displayed while others remain hidden.  
This behavior is similar to basic DOM manipulation, but it is achieved using CSS properties like `display`, `:target`, or `:checked`.
